# iTop module : Data Synchronization Dashboard

## About

This extension provides an overview of all Data Synchro Sources (last run, number of replicas, number of errors…) 


## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get
 a running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
 additional modules.
